	abstract = {This paper reviews the large and growing literature which tests PPP and other models of the long-run real exchange rate.  We distinguish three different stages of PPP testing and focus on what has been learned from each.  The most important overall lesson has been that the real exchange rate appears stationary over sufficiently long horizons.  Simple, univariate random walk specifications can be rejected in favor of stationary alternatives.  However, we argue that multivariate tests, which ask whether any linear combination of prices and exchange rates are stationary, have not necessarily provided meaningful rejections of nonstationarity.  We also review a number of other theories of the long run real exchange rate -- including the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis -- as well as the evidence supporting them.  We argue that the persistence of real exchange rate movements can be generated by a number of sensible models and that Balassa- Samuelson effects seem important, but mainly for countries with widely disparate levels of income of growth.  Finally, this paper presents new evidence testing the law of one price on 200 years of historical commodity price data for England and France, and uses a century of data from Argentina to test the possibility of sample-selection bias in tests of long-run PPP.},

	OPTabstract = {We survey the empirical literature on floating nominal exchange rates over the past decade.  Exchange rates are difficult to forecast at short- to medium-term horizons.  There is a bit of explanatory power to monetary models such as the Dornbusch 'overshooting' theory, in the form of reaction to 'news' and in forecasts at long-run horizons.  Nevertheless, at short horizons, a driftless random walk characterizes exchange rates better than standard models based on observable macroeconomic fundamentals.  Unexplained large shocks to floating rates must then, logically, be due either to innovations in unobservable fundamentals, or to non-fundamental factors such as speculative bubbles.  The observed difference in exchange rate and macroeconomic volatility under different nominal exchange rate regimes makes us skeptical of the first view.  The theory and evidence on speculative bubbles, however, is not conclusive.  We conclude with the hope that promising new studies of the microstructure of the foreign exchange market might eventually rise to insights into these phenomena.},

% EXCHANGE RATES IN EMERGING ECONOMIES: WHAT DO WE KNOW?

Issues related to the feasibility of flexible exchange rates, the relationship between exchange rate volatility and growth, and the role of exchange rate overvaluation in recent crises, among other, have been extensively discussed during the last few years.  In this paper we address some of the most important exchange rate-related issues in emerging economies.  In particular, we deal with:  (a) the merits of alternative exchange rate regimes:  (b) the extent to which purchasing power parity holds in the long run in these countries;  and (c) models to assess real exchange rate overvaluation.  We also discuss future areas for research on exchange rates in the emerging nations.},

	abstract = {Standard models of exchange rates, based on macroeconomic variables such as prices, interest rates, output, etc., are thought by many researchers to have failed empirically.  We present evidence to the contrary.  First, we emphasize the point that "beating a random walk" in forecasting is too strong a criterion for accepting an exchange rate model.  Typically models should have low forecasting power of this type.  We then propose a number of alternative ways to evaluate models.  We examine in-sample fit, but emphasize the importance of the monetary policy rule, and its effects on expectations, in determining exchange rates.  Next we present evidence that exchange rates incorporate news about future macroeconomic fundamentals, as the models imply.  We demonstrate that the models might well be able to account for observed exchange-rate volatility.  We discuss studies that examine the response of exchange rates to announcements of economic data.  Then we present estimates of exchange-rate models in which expected present values of fundamentals are calculated from survey forecasts.  Finally, we show that out-of-sample forecasting power of models can be increased by focusing on panel estimation and long-horizon forecasts.},
